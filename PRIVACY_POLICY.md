## Overview

The Prayer Times Chrome Extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our extension.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- **Where**: Stored locally in Chrome's sync storage
- **Sharing**: Only synced across your own Chrome browsers (Chrome's built-in feature)

### External Services Used

When you search for a location (e.g., "London, UK"), we use:
- **Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)**: Free geocoding service
- **What we send**: Only the location name you typed

We do not send any personal information to this service - only the location search terms you provide.
